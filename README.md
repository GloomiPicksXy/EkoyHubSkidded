# How it started

So Around 3 days ago, I got heated argument with the owner of the script.
I was saying why not making it free since you only used
"SetPrimaryPartCframe" He banned me on his server. Little did he know I skidded his script

```
getgenv().Bruh = true;

while wait(0.4) do
    if getgenv().Bruh == true then
        game.workspace.Buses["3554173983:Bus"]:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(CFrame.new(-9023.6357421875, 6.831459999084473, 5182.5615234375))
        wait(0.2)
        game.workspace.Buses["3554173983:Bus"]:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(CFrame.new(1305.6409912109375, 6.819954872131348, 999.3180541992188)) --facing default way
    end
end
```

-- he couldn't make autofarm so I made it myself for my great skidding
